# Mental Health App
This is a simple app using Flutter. The application consists of a single page.

There are no redirects to another page or active buttons in the application. We can think of it as an interface to learn and use a few new things in Flutter.

 - At the top, there is a user-specific message, a bell for notifications, a search bar, and emojis that the user can choose according to their current mood.
 - Exercises are listed at the bottom of the screen. We can think of these as topics that the user wants and is interested in getting suggestions from. User-specific content and reminders are displayed here.
 - There is bottom navigation bar, but no redirects to other pages. Currently only serves as a visual.
